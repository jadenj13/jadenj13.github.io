			<p>My name is Jaden Johnson. I am a passionate full-stack Javascript developer living in Salt Lake City. I am dedicated to building scalable, testable and responsive web applications for computer and mobile use. I work in a collabrative style with you to build you a website that we both can be proud of.</p>
			<p>When I'm not at work or plugged in to my MacBook, I spend my time with my family whom I pull my inspiration from. My wife and daughter drive me to be the best that I can in everything that I do. I owe all my motivation and success to these two girls!</p>
			<p>I developed my passion for code and Javascript while finishing my degree at the University of Utah. I especially enjoy learning new technologies and implementing them into my projects.</p>
